Veretino 0.3.2
* Added the ability to create a global Filter based on the Folder Content analyzer.
* Added the ability to quickly create an independent Filter when calculating checksums for folder contents.

Veretino 0.3.1
* Added a new universal Database Status dialog. Now information about database changes and verification results are also displayed in this dialog box.
* Added an improved Folder Content analyzer. There is now support for sorting the list of extensions by total size or number of files, as well as filtering the Top10 of the largest or most numerous file types.
* Now the database stores not only the update time, but also the time of the last successful check (when all files from the list are present on the disk and their current checksums have been calculated and match).
* Now the database does not store the WorkDir value unnecessarily.
* Pressing Enter again in the path edit field performs a quick action (compute/verify file's checksum or open database). And in the case of an empty field, there is no unnecessary warning about the wrong path.
* In the Database Status dialog box: double-clicking on the database file name or WorkDir opens the path in the system file manager.
* Fixed an error in resetting a newly created database if WorkDir is specified.
* Minor improvements to popup messages.

Veretino 0.3.0
* The internal data architecture has been redesigned.
* Now, when calculating checksums for a list of files (selected folder), a visual model is created that displays the details of the process: which files are in the queue and which have already been processed. The checksum and, if verification is running, the result of the compliance check are immediately visible.
* Added menu item "Forget all changes". Now, when a database is overwritten, a temporary backup copy is created. This makes it possible to undo all changes by restoring the original database from a backup.
* The program now prevents all items from being deleted from the database. For example, in the case when all the listed files are missing on the disk.
* Added sorting feature. Also, now when viewing the database model, folders are grouped top/bottom.
* In database browsing mode, the saved checksums are now displayed, and, if mismatches are detected, the newly calculated checksums (ReChecksums) are also displayed. Both of these columns can be hidden.
* Added a context menu for the "SHA-Button", allowing to quickly change the Algorithm (SHA-1 : SHA-256 : SHA-512).
* The main context menu has become more functional.
* Added the ability to copy a recomputed checksum (ReChecksum) to the clipboard.
* Now file statuses are always displayed.
* Notifications when calculations are completed have become a little more informative.
* Multiple small improvements
