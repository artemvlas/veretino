Veretino 0.3.0
* The internal data architecture has been redesigned.
* Now, when calculating checksums for a list of files (selected folder), a visual model is created that displays the details of the process: which files are in the queue and which have already been processed. The checksum and, if verification is running, the result of the compliance check are immediately visible.
* Added menu item "Forget all changes". Now, when a database is overwritten, a temporary backup copy is created. This makes it possible to undo all changes by restoring the original database from a backup.
* The program now prevents all items from being deleted from the database. For example, in the case when all the listed files are missing on the disk.
* Added sorting feature. Also, now when viewing the database model, folders are grouped top/bottom.
* In database browsing mode, the saved checksums are now displayed, and, if mismatches are detected, the newly calculated checksums (ReChecksums) are also displayed. Both of these columns can be hidden.
* Added a context menu for the "SHA-Button", allowing to quickly change the Algorithm (SHA-1 : SHA-256 : SHA-512).
* Added the ability to copy a recomputed checksum (ReChecksum) to the clipboard.
* Now file statuses are always displayed.
* Notifications when calculations are completed have become a little more informative.
* Multiple small improvements
