Veretino 0.5.2
* Implemented the ability to detect Moved files.
    Added item Status: "Moved". It will mark renamed or moved files [if enabled in settings].
    An item will be marked with the "Moved" status if its computed checksum matches any Missing item's one.
* Added the ability to import Branches. If the subfolder contains New Items and also has a separate database file, its data can be imported.
* Implemented import from digest files (*.sha1/256/512) to DB item ("new file" status only).
* DateTime stamp inheritance during Branching has become a bit smarter.
    If the selected subfolder contains only checked and matched items, the Branch will be created with a new timestamp, as a new DB.
* Improved Presets for filterable file types.
* Minor improvements to UI and dialog boxes.

Veretino 0.5.1
* Fixed saving the DB file name prefix.

Veretino 0.5.0
What's new:
* New Database Creation Dialog, combining basic settings and filter creation.
* A newly creating database can be flagged as immutable ("Deny Changes"), which will prevent changes to it in the future.
* Improved file type filter creation process.
    Instead of a Permanent filter, selected extensions can be flexibly remembered between sessions, adapting to the contents of working folders.
* It is now possible to check the modification date of listed files during database parsing.
    Makes it easier to work with obviously changed items.
* The Contents List (folder or db) now supports multiple selections and displays the corresponding amounts.
* Now files without read permissions can be excluded when creating the list (customizable).
* Added the ability to export individual checksums from the database to a digest file (*.ver(.json) --> *.sha1/256/512).
* Copying files and folders is now also available when browsing the file system.
* The Unreadable Status is divided into two separate ones: UnPermitted ("no permissions") and ReadError ("read error").
    The first means no read permissions. Second, an error occurred during reading (damaged file: bad block, disk or file system error).

Fixes and Minor Enhancements:
* Fixed display of item's zero-byte size.
* Folder Contents dialog: fixed adding the sizes of files without read permissions.
* Fixed crash when opening a database while another parsing is ongoing.
* Improved parsing of items that were marked unreadable during database creation.
* Menu action "Open Branch": added finding renamed branch files.
* Added finding of all existing databases in the working folder.

Internal changes:
* Redesigned task management system.
* Significant optimization of the Data Model creation process (x10 faster for Large lists).
* Multiple optimizations of basic functions.

Removed:
* Permanent Filter.
    And the Presets have been moved to the Db Creation Dialog (context menu in the Filter section).
* "Colored Items" setting. Now is always on.
* Menu Setting for display the number of updatable items.

* The database now stores the date and time it was created as a separate value.
* The speed display is brought to the standard form: MiB/sec >> MiB/s
* In the path input field, the clear button is hidden when it doesn't make sense.
* Prevented some database columns from being accidentally hidden on first run.
* When working with a Desktop folder, there is no longer an unnecessary notification of a reserve save path.
* If the last saved path does not exist, it now goes to the parent folder, if there is one.
* After creating a new database, the path to it is now remembered when returning to the file system.
* Smarter behavior of the Esc key when working with the database, prevented accidental closure (prompt added).
* Added some shortcuts.
