# The Scripts were created and tested on Arch Linux (or based).
# Other distros may have different command and package names, so some changes may need to be made.

# Building and running the application requires to be installed on the system:
    qt5[6]-base
    qt5[6]-svg
    base-devel (make, gcc, etc...)
    cmake (for cmake builds)

# If it's not, do:
sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake

# Script files must be executable, if not:
chmod +x scriptFileName.sh
